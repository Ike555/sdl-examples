Various SDL examples for my course.

##Building


In project directory, issue 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

That gives you reasonable build files. With Windows and Visual Studio 2013,
please remember to use either 
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio" ..
```

or for 64-bit development environment:

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio Win64" ..
```
